## CRM Analytics (Customer Relationship Management)  

### Introduction to CRM Analytics  
**Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** is a combination of strategies, processes, and technologies that help businesses improve customer interactions, manage data, boost sales, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize business operations.  

### Key Processes in CRM

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  

### What are KPIs?  
KPIs are measurable metrics used to evaluate performance at various organizational levels. These metrics are typically monitored over time, combined with visual tools for better insights, and are critical for improving business strategies.  

### Examples of KPIs  
1. **Customer Acquisition Rate**  
   - Measures the percentage of new customers acquired during a specific time frame.  
   - Example: Tracking how many customers joined after a marketing campaign.  
2. **Customer Retention Rate**  
   - Indicates the percentage of customers who continue using a product or service.  
   - Example: Monitoring app usage over several months to measure loyalty.  
3. **Customer Churn Rate**  
   - Tracks the percentage of customers who leave a company during a given period.  
   - Example: Subscription services analyzing membership cancellations.  
4. **Conversion Rate**  
   - Measures how many users take a desired action, such as making a purchase.  
   - Example: Evaluating the effectiveness of an ad campaign by tracking purchases.  
5. **Growth Rate**  
   - Monitors progress toward long-term goals.  
   - Example: A start-up comparing user growth over a year.

## Cohort Analysis  

### What is a Cohort?  
A cohort is a group of individuals with shared characteristics or experiences, such as customers who made a purchase in the same period.  

### What is Cohort Analysis?  
Cohort analysis examines the behaviors of a group over time to identify trends and patterns.  

#### Example: Churn Rate Analysis  
Tracking customer churn rates helps businesses understand loyalty trends, enabling them to refine strategies and foster long-term relationships.

## RFM Analysis  

### Overview  
RFM stands for **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary** value. This method groups customers based on purchasing behavior, helping businesses develop tailored strategies.  

### RFM Metrics  
1. **Recency (R)**: How recently a customer made a purchase.  
2. **Frequency (F)**: The total number of purchases by a customer.  
3. **Monetary (M)**: The total value contributed by the customer.  

### RFM Scoring  
- Scores range from 1 to 5, with Recency scored inversely (recent purchases are rated higher).  
- Example: A customer with scores R=5, F=4, M=2 has an RFM score of 542.

## Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)  

### What is CLTV?  
CLTV estimates the total monetary value a customer brings to a business during their relationship.  

### Importance of CLTV  
- Helps predict customer behavior and optimize marketing budgets.  
- Compares the value of retaining customers versus acquiring new ones.  

### CLTV Calculation  
1. **Customer Value**:  
   - Average Order Value = Total Revenue / Total Transactions  
   - Purchase Frequency = Total Transactions / Total Customers  
2. **Churn Rate**:  
   - Churn Rate = 1 - Repeat Rate  
3. **Profit Margin**:  
   - Profit Margin = Total Revenue × Assumed Margin  
4. **CLTV**:  
   - CLTV = (Customer Value / Churn Rate) × Profit Margin  

### Example Calculation  
- Total Customers: 100  
- Total Revenue: $1,200  
- Transactions: 3  
- Profit Margin: 10%  
- Churn Rate: 0.8  

**Steps**:  
1. **Average Order Value** = $1,200 / 3 = $400  
2. **Purchase Frequency** = 3 / 100 = 0.03  
3. **Profit Margin** = $1,200 × 0.10 = $120  
4. **Customer Value** = $400 × 0.03 = $12  
5. **CLTV** = ($12 / 0.8) × $120 = $1,800  

This example shows the estimated lifetime value of a customer to be $1,800, which guides strategic decisions for maximizing profitability.
